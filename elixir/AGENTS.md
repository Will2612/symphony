# Symphony Elixir

This directory contains the Elixir agent orchestration service that polls Linear, creates per-issue workspaces, and runs Codex in app-server mode.

## Environment

- Elixir: `1.19.x` (OTP 28) via `mise`.
- Install deps: `mix setup`.
- `make all` = `ci` = `setup → build → fmt-check → lint (specs.check + credo --strict) → coverage → dialyzer`.
- Escript builds to `bin/symphony` via `mix escript.build`.
- Formatter line length is **200** (`.formatter.exs`).
- No database — all orchestrator state is in-memory. Restart loses blocked-issue map.
- Template rendering uses **Solid** (Liquid-compatible, strict variable checking).

## Codebase-Specific Conventions

- Runtime config is loaded from `WORKFLOW.md` front matter via `SymphonyElixir.Workflow` and `SymphonyElixir.Config`.
- Keep the implementation aligned with [`../SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) where practical.
  - The implementation may be a superset of the spec.
  - The implementation must not conflict with the spec.
  - If implementation changes meaningfully alter the intended behavior, update the spec in the same
    change where practical so the spec stays current.
- Prefer adding config access through `SymphonyElixir.Config` instead of ad-hoc env reads.
- Workspace safety is critical:
  - Never run Codex turn cwd in source repo.
  - Workspaces must stay under configured workspace root.
- Orchestrator behavior is stateful and concurrency-sensitive; preserve retry, reconciliation, and cleanup semantics.
- Follow `docs/logging.md` for logging conventions and required issue/session context fields.

## Tests and Validation

Run targeted tests while iterating, then run full gates before handoff.

```bash
make all
```

Coverage target is **100%** but many integration-level modules are ignored in `mix.exs` (Config, Orchestrator, AgentRunner, Codex.AppServer, HttpServer, all Web modules, and others). Unit test coverage applies to the remaining modules.

E2E test (`test/symphony_elixir/live_e2e_test.exs`) creates real Linear resources and launches a real `codex app-server` session:
```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY=...
make e2e
```
Optional: `SYMPHONY_LIVE_LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` (default `SYME2E`), `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS`.

## Required Rules

- Public functions (`def`) in `lib/` must have an adjacent `@spec`.
- `defp` specs are optional.
- `@impl` callback implementations are exempt from local `@spec` requirement.
- Keep changes narrowly scoped; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Follow existing module/style patterns in `lib/symphony_elixir/*`.

Validation command:

```bash
mix specs.check
```

## PR Requirements

- PR body must follow `../.github/pull_request_template.md` exactly.
- Validate PR body locally when needed:

```bash
mix pr_body.check --file /path/to/pr_body.md
```

## Docs Update Policy

If behavior/config changes, update docs in the same PR:

- `../README.md` for project concept and goals.
- `README.md` for Elixir implementation and run instructions.
- `WORKFLOW.md` for workflow/config contract changes.
